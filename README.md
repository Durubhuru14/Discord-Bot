## Installation



1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-bot-repo.git

    ```



2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash

    npm install

    ```



## Configuration



Before running the bot, you will need to set up two configuration files: `.env` and `config.json`.



### 1. Setting up the `.env` File



Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:



```env

TOKEN=your-bot-token-here

GUILD_ID=your-guild-id-here

CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here

```



- `TOKEN`: Your bot token from Discord Developer Portal.

- `GUILD_ID`: The ID of the server where your bot will operate.

- `CLIENT_ID`: Your bot's client ID from Discord Developer Portal.



### 2. Setting up the `config.json` File



Create a `config.json` file in the root of your project and configure it as follows:



```json

{

  "server": "your-guild-id-here",

  "ClientId": "your-client-id-here",

  "devs": ["your-discord-id-here"]

}

```



- `server`: The ID of the server where the bot is active.

- `ClientId`: The client ID of your bot.

- `devs`: An array of Discord user IDs of the developers with access.



**Note:** Ensure that both files are included in your `.gitignore` to prevent them from being tracked by Git.



## Running the Bot



Once you have set up the configuration files, you can run the bot with:



```bash

node index.js

```
